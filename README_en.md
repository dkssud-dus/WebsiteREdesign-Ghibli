## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1. Background
Studio Ghibli is a global animation brand with numerous fans not only in Japan but also overseas. However, the official homepage only supported Japanese, making accessibility significantly low for international fans. Additionally, convenience and necessity features for users (search, top button, etc.) were lacking, which could cause difficulties in usage. Both main and sub pages displayed information in simple text format, failing to properly utilize Studio Ghibli's IP.

</br>

The purpose of this project is as follows:

</br>

1. We want to materialize the brand image of 'Studio Ghibli'.
2. We want to serve as a portal that delivers not only official information but also cultural content.
3. We want to create a global site that can be easily accessed by fans worldwide, not just domestic Japanese fans.

</br>

2. **Multilingual Support**   
  2.1. Official hub for Studio Ghibli fans worldwide

</br>

3. **Intuitiveness**   
  3.1. Simple and clear, considering user convenience
